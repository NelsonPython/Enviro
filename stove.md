It can be easy to get distracted and forget to turn off a burner.  Enviro can sense the temperature change when the burner is on.

<h3>Warning</h3>
Enviro was not designed to sit beside the burner.  It is not waterproof and could be damaged when you cook.  I hung my sensor in a plastic bag without ziplocking it so the device will not overheat.  This is a temporary solution while I run experiments.
