<h1>Protecting you from leaving the stove burner on</h1>

<img src="images/burnerOn.jpg">

A human can get distracted and forget to turn off a burner.  To begin, Enviro is reporting a temperature change greater than 1 degree Celsius in less than 8 minutes.  This criteria indicates that a burner may have been left on.  In the future, Enviro can improve this criteria based on feedback.

When Enviro determines that a burner has been left on, it sends a text.  It uses IFTTT Webhooks along with Pushbullet.  You must install the Pushbullet app on your phone to get the text.

<h3>Warning</h3>
Enviro was not designed to sit beside the burner.  It is not waterproof and could be damaged when you cook.  I hung my sensor in a plastic bag without ziplocking it so the device will not overheat.  This is a temporary solution while I run experiments.

<h3>heatAlert.py</h3>

This script checks the temperature and determines whether the burner has been left on.  In the future, it will learn the best criteria
