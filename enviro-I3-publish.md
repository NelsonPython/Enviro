# Publishing data to the I3 Data Marketplace

<b>This code walkthrough explains how to publish EnviroPhat data to the I3 Data Marketplace</b>  

### Setting up your account and registering your product
Use [Connecting an IoT Device to the I3 Data Marketplace](https://github.com/NelsonPython/Connect_IoT_Device_to_I3).  It has step-by-step instructions for signing up to get your API key and password and registering your product.

Decide how often you will publish data.  [enviro_publish.py](https://github.com/NelsonPython/EnviroPhat/blob/master/code/enviro_publish.py) will publish data one time.  You can use cron or another scheduler to publish data periodically, for example, every 30 minutes.  

### Importing libraries
```
#!/usr/bin/python

"""
Purpose: publish EnviroPhat environment data
"""
```
Import the [Eclipse Paho MQTT Python client library](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) so you can publish sensor data to your subscribers 
```
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
```
In order for your data to be meaningful, you must report the time it was sensed so import time and datetime libraries

```
import time
import datetime
```
Data is passed using a json format so import json libraries
```
import json
```
Import the EnviroPhat libraries so you can take sensor readings
```
from envirophat import light, motion, weather,leds
```

### on_connect function

This function connects to the broker and prints the status of the connection
```
def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    """printing out result code when connecting with the broker

    Args:
        client: publisher
        userdata:
        flags:
        rc: result code

    Returns:

    """

    m="Connected flags"+str(flags)+"\nresult code " +str(rc)+"\nclient1_id  "+st                                                                             r(client)
    print(m)
```
### on_message function

This function prints the sensor data
```
def on_message(client1, userdata, message):
    """printing out received message

    Args:
        client1: publisher
        userdata:
        message: recieved data

    Returns:

    """
    print("message received  "  ,str(message.payload.decode("utf-8")))
```

### getSensorData() function

This functions senses light, color, pressure, temperature, heading, accelerometer readings and provides device name, location and GPS coordinates of this device

```
def getSensorData():
    sensors = {}
    t = datetime.datetime.now()
    sensors["timestamp"] = str(t.strftime('%Y%m%d %H:%M'))
    sensors["device_name"] = "YOUR ENVIROPHAT"
    sensors["city"] = 'YOUR CITY'
    sensors["lng"] = 'YOUR LONGITUDE'
    sensors["lat"] = 'YOUR LATITUDE'

    sensors["lux"] = light.light()
    leds.on()
    sensors["rgb"] = str(light.rgb())[1:-1].replace(' ','')
    leds.off()
    sensors["accel"] = str(motion.accelerometer())[1:-1].replace(' ','')
    sensors["heading"] = motion.heading()
    sensors["temperature"] = weather.temperature()
    sensors["pressure"] = weather.pressure()

    return sensors
```
Use your account and password.  The topic is the product you are publishing on the I3 Data Marketplace.  The broker address and port are provided.

### main
```
if __name__ == '__main__':

    account = 'YOUR-USERNAME'
    pw = 'YOUR-PASSWORD'
    topic = "YOUR TOPIC NAME"

    try:
        pub_client = mqtt.Client(account)
        pub_client.on_connect = on_connect
        pub_client.on_message = on_message
        pub_client.username_pw_set(account, pw)
        pub_client.connect('I3 MARKETPLACE IP ADDRESS', PORT)      #connect to broker

    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception", str(e))

```
The payload contains the sensor data.  Once it is printed and published, the script disconnects.
```
    payload = getSensorData()
    print(payload)
    pub_client.publish(topic, json.dumps(payload))
    time.sleep(1)
    pub_client.disconnect()
```
